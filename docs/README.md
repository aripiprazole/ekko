# Writing Haskell in Kotlin

This article talks about implementing a Haskell-like interpreter in Kotlin. That comes from
writing the parser, type system, context resolving to the interpreter.

The goal of this article, is to show a short introduction to compilers, interpreters, and
type systems. You can read more [here](9_more_content.md).

This is not production-ready and not scientific material, but it is a good starting point for
learning.
